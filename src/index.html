                  </div>
                  <p>I began as a full stack developer in the back-office ecosystem at Konfio.mx, the biggest fin-tech in Mexico. I developed, implemented, and maintained a robust codebase that helped the company get to Series A investment.</p>

I worked on improving the whole experience to be mobile-first and to rank 96 out of 100 in Google's speed and performance tests, taking the company's website to be 1st in the loans and credits search results and no. 1 in the SMB loans industry in Mexico.</p>
