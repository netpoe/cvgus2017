              <h3>Experience</h3>
              <p>During my programming career, I've collaborated in the design, architecture, development and deployment of successful projects, varying from web apps for the fin-tech industry, to CS education IDE's, non-profit education programs, universities CMS’s and healthcare.</p>

              </div>
              <p>I began as a PHP Full Stack Developer in the back-office ecosystem at Konfio.mx, the biggest fin-tech in Mexico. I developed, implemented, and maintained a robust codebase that helped the company get to Series A investment.</p>
              <p>I was later promoted to the product team where I developed for performance and modularity. I worked on improving the whole experience to be mobile-first and to rank 96 out of 100 in Google's speed and performance tests, taking the company's website to be 1st in the loans and credits search results and no. 1 in the SMB loans industry in Mexico.</p>

              <p>I achieved to communicate complex knowledge in an easy way, as the users were mainly elementary level students, resulting in new investment opportunities for the company.</p>

              <p>I was part of the founding team of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/nbr9-PR2FH/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">educational program Laboratoria in Peru</a>. I worked to empower vulnerable women with high potential to become proactive developers.</p>
              <p>During the early stages of the program, I taught full-stack web-development to 3 promotions empowering around 70 women. I built the course structure and methodologies now used in 2 Peru cities, Santiago de Chile, and Mexico City, achieving to empower a total of 400 students from which 75% get a development job and have a 3.0x increase in their income.</p>

              <p>I was an intern in the Shopify headquarters in Ottawa, Canada, as part of the top students selected in the Jr. Ruby on Rails developers program hosted by Hacker You, a popular development bootcamp.</p>
              <p>I won the 1st place of the program having designed and developed the frontend for the project: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/dpFAdNR2E3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SAM (Simple Appointment Management)</a>. The project was later chosen by a group of investors in Peru to become the first patient to doctor web application in the country.</p>

              <p>The Easy Box Model is a <code>npm</code> package that allows very rapid and modular prototyping setting the foundations for what can become a bigger product.</p>
              <p>It is modular by itself as it can fit in any web framework by assigning a source and destination path.</p>
              <p>It also introduces a modular Sass and modular JS file structure that meets the MVC model directory organization of most web applications.</p>

              <p>A PHP composer package for bootstraping web applications onboarding flows</p>
              <p>I developed this package in order to accelerate the development of web forms. Laravel already provides an easy way to validate requests, but this package allows to integrate Blade templating language with pre-built form inputs and an easy way to configure each field to be saved on a specific model.</p>

              <p>I wanted to learn about image classification so I built this project divided into a <em>Front &amp; an Admin</em> interface.</p>
              <p>The Admin interface allows the admin user to upload product images that are later classified by clothing taxonomies and are later presented to the end-user allowing him to shuffle outfits and checkout easily through a private shopping cart.</p>
