              <h3>Experience</h3>
              <p>During my programming career, I've collaborated in the design, architecture, development and deployment of successful projects, varying from web apps for the fin-tech industry, to CS education IDE's, non-profit education programs, universities CMS’s and healthcare.</p>

              </div>
              <p>I began as a full stack developer in the back-office ecosystem at Konfio.mx, the biggest fin-tech in Mexico. I developed, implemented, and maintained a robust codebase that helped the company get to Series A investment.</p>
              <p>I was later promoted to the product team where I designed for performance and modularity. I worked on improving the whole experience to be mobile-first and to rank 96 out of 100 in Google's speed and performance tests, taking the company's website to be 1st in the loans and credits search results and no. 1 in the SMB loans industry in Mexico.</p>

              <p>During the early stages of the program, I taught full-stack web-development to 3 promotions empowering around 70 women. I built the course structure and methodologies now used in 2 Peru cities, Santiago de Chile, and Mexico City, achieving to empower a total of 400 students from which 75% get a development job and have a 3.0x increase in their income.</p>

              <p>The Easy Box Model is a <code>npm</code> package that allows very rapid and modular prototyping setting the foundations for what can become a bigger product.</p>
              <p>It is modular by itself as it can fit in any web framework by assigning a source and destination path.</p>
              <p>It also introduces a modular Sass and modular JS file structure that meets the MVC model directory organization of most web applications.</p>

              <p>Work: I enjoy team code ownership as it benefits innovation as there's no "expert" in something resulting in disruptive projects.</p>
