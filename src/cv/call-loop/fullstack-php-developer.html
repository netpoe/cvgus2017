              <p>Not only is Gus an incredible self-taught developer, but he is one of a kind. His personality, knowledge of software architecture, design patterns and creative skills make him unique. He is unlike any other developer I've worked with. To be honest, from my 4+ years working as a software engineer, there is no one I would rather work with than Gus.</p>

              <p>I've known Gustavo since I first started in web development. He's exactly the kind of person a scrappy young startup needs: a "Unicorn" (a designer and developer). He can whip up a design on PhotoShop / InVision and then code it up himself. If I were running a startup, he would be the first person I would be looking to hire.</p>

              <p>Gustavo is a great person to have on your team. He's one of those upbeat individuals that knows how to get things done. Having started as a designer, he has a great understanding and appreciation of the design process as it pertains to front-end development. He's taken the initiative to teach himself many front-end technologies, and would be a strong addition to any agile startup.</p>

              <h3>About me</h3>
              <p>My full name is Gustavo Andr√©s Ibarra Mart√≠nez. I was born in Mexico City in the year of 1989, the same year of the fall of the Berlin Wall. I like to remember this event because I still belong to the 80's, proudly pre-millenial. ‚òù</p>
              <p>I developed a passion for coding at a late age, 21 to be precise, before that time, I was still being a rebel in life; I dropped-out from University twice. The reason? It was boring.</p>
              <p>I found the command-line, Sublime Text 2 and the browser to be the best teachers and I got myself a scholarship at a Shopify dev-bootcamp in Canada.</p>
              <p>This is what I've achieved since then: <a href="http://soygus.com" target="_blank">link to my CV</a></p>

              <h3>The biggest challenge</h3>
              <p>I took a dive into the current features of CallLoop.com and I noticed lots of SMS possibilities, which I didn't know about.</p>
              <p>Personally, I see text messaging as immortal as the radio. What's most challenging for me is to dig into the communications technologies behind CallLoop, I'll probably be working with many new APIs and clients. I expect to read lots of documentation.</p>
              <p>Also, I read about Call Loop 3.0, which probably doesn't mean from scratch, there most be very valuable code from previous versions that may need to be considered before writing any new line of code.</p>
              <p>I'm up for it! üí™</p>
